Project Title: Job Listing and Resume Matching with Elasticsearch (ELS)

Introduction:
In today's competitive job market, efficiently matching job listings with suitable resumes is crucial for both employers and job seekers. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a sophisticated system using Elasticsearch, a powerful search and analytics engine. Leveraging Elasticsearch's full-text search capabilities and advanced querying features, the system enables seamless matching based on skills, experience, and education criteria extracted from both job listings and resumes. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed for feature extraction and analysis to enhance matching accuracy.

Project Overview:
The project involves indexing job listings and resumes into Elasticsearch, applying NLP techniques for feature extraction, and implementing an intelligent matching algorithm based on Elasticsearch's querying capabilities. Job data, including required skills, experience titles, and required education, is generated using Faker to simulate real-world scenarios. Resumes are also generated with similar parameters to ensure diverse and comprehensive testing. The system then indexes this data into Elasticsearch, allowing for efficient querying and matching.

Features:
The key features of the project include:

Indexing of Job Listings and Resumes: Job listings and resumes are indexed into Elasticsearch for efficient storage and retrieval.
Utilization of Elasticsearch for Full-Text Search: Elasticsearch's powerful search capabilities are leveraged to perform full-text search on indexed documents.
Advanced Querying for Matching Criteria: Elasticsearch's querying capabilities are utilized to perform advanced searches based on specific criteria such as skills, experience, and education.
Integration of NLP for Feature Extraction: Natural Language Processing techniques are employed to extract relevant features from job listings and resumes, enhancing the matching algorithm's accuracy.
Automated Matching Algorithm: An intelligent matching algorithm is implemented to automatically match job listings with suitable resumes based on predefined criteria.
